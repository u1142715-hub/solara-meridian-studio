    <h2 class="landing-section__title">FAQ</h2>
    <div class="landing-faq-list">
      <details>
        <summary>Where do I purchase the artwork?</summary>
        <p>
          All purchasing, payments, and shipping for premium pieces are handled through Saatchi Art
          on the Solara Meridian Studio profile.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer print-on-demand options?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Selected designs are available as print-on-demand pieces on Redbubble for accessible
          prints, apparel, and accessories.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Will this work with neutral interiors?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Many works are built around soft stone, sand, and mist tones so they sit quietly in
          neutral spaces, with the option to introduce deeper jewel accents where needed.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can I commission a specific palette?</summary>
        <p>
          Commissions may be available depending on the studio schedule. If open, we’ll refine a
          palette and scale together and then translate that into a cohesive composition.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How often are new works released?</summary>
        <p>
          New pieces and collections are developed intentionally rather than on a fixed schedule, so
          the studio’s visual language evolves without overwhelming the core series.
