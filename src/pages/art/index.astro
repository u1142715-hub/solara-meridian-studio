          The Origin Forms reframes a commonly mocked failure mode into composed, collectible work—guided by restraint,

          <h3>Controlled recomposition</h3>
          <p>
            Artefacts are selected, stabilised, and composed into finished works. Scarcity comes from judgement,
            not output volume.

          <h3>Restraint as a signature</h3>

            Precision without coldness; complexity without noise. The work is designed to reveal itself over time,
            rather than compete for attention.

            fracture logic, but the intent remains art-first, not decorative.

        <details>
          <summary>Where do I purchase the artwork?</summary>

            All purchasing, payments, and shipping for originals and limited editions are handled through Saatchi Art
            on the Solara Meridian Studio profile.

            Yes. Separately, the studio also maintains a print-on-demand shop on{" "}

        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Will this work with neutral interiors?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. Many works are tuned to sit calmly within neutral spaces. Surface tones may stay quiet, with the option
            for deeper accents where needed—without overwhelming the room.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I commission a specific palette?</summary>
          <p>
            Commissions may be available depending on the studio schedule. If open, we’ll refine a palette and scale together
            and then translate that into a cohesive composition.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How often are new works released?</summary>
          <p>
            New pieces and collections are developed intentionally rather than on a fixed schedule, so the studio’s visual
            language evolves without overwhelming the core series.
