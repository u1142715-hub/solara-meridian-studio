    <h2 class="landing-section__title">FAQ</h2>
    <div class="landing-faq-list">
      <details>
        <summary>Where do I purchase the artwork?</summary>
        <p>
          All purchasing, payments, and shipping for premium pieces are handled through Saatchi Art
          on the Solara Meridian Studio profile.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer print-on-demand options?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes. Selected designs are available as print-on-demand pieces on Redbubble for accessible
          prints, apparel, and accessories.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Will this work with neutral interiors?</summary>
        <p>
          Most collections are built on deep charcoal, softened neutrals, and carefully controlled
          jewel accents, so they sit comfortably alongside timber, stone, and muted fabrics.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Are new collections added over time?</summary>
        <p>
          New marble-inlay, geometric, and rune-inspired works are added gradually, so the catalogue
          evolves without overwhelming the core series.
