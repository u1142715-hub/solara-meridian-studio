        <div class="section__eyebrow">Origin</div>

      <div class="card">
        <p class="card__body" style="opacity: 0.9;">
          The context below is not a justification of the work, but the conditions that made it inevitable.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          I didn’t begin as a gifted prodigy, and I didn’t arrive at art through a single defining moment.
          The path was slower—shaped by persistence more than talent.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          As a child, I drew like many kids do: simple sketches, small ideas. Over time, drawing faded into the
          background—not because creativity disappeared, but because it began expressing itself in other forms.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          That shift led me to technology. From an early age, computers fascinated me as systems—logic, structure,
          cause and effect.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          I began to notice how communication subtly changes depending on situation and audience, why trust forms
          in some circumstances and not others.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Before returning to study, life took a practical direction. After school, I entered the building industry
          and spent roughly twenty years working as a carpenter.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          In 2019, my mother passed away.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          One of the hardest aspects was the loss of connection.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Early attempts were poor. But I continued deliberately.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Digital work eventually felt inevitable.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Working digitally allowed calm to become a design choice rather than an accident.
