        <div class="section__eyebrow">Origin</div>

        <!-- Framing sentence: critical for hybrid model -->
        <p class="card__body" style="opacity: 0.9;">
          The context below is not a justification of the work, but the conditions that made it inevitable.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          I didn’t begin as a gifted prodigy, and I didn’t arrive at art through a single defining moment.
          The path was slower—shaped by persistence more than talent.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          As a child, I drew like many kids do: simple sketches, small ideas. Over time, drawing faded into the
          background—not because creativity disappeared, but because it began expressing itself in other forms.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          That shift led me to technology. From an early age, computers fascinated me as systems—logic, structure,
          cause and effect. Over time, that interest expanded beyond tools into how information, meaning,
          and trust form in different contexts.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          I began to notice how communication subtly changes depending on situation and audience, why trust forms
          in some circumstances and not others, and how people interpret intention under uncertainty. This wasn’t
          about manipulation—it was about understanding how humans actually behave. That understanding later became
          essential to how I think about art as communication, not just expression.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Before returning to study, life took a practical direction. After school, I entered the building industry
          and spent roughly twenty years working as a carpenter—an apprenticeship in quality, material awareness,
          precision, and restraint.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          In 2019, my mother passed away. She had been creative herself—working with sculpture and later painting—
          but like many people, art often took a back seat to responsibility. Her death marked a difficult chapter,
          not only emotionally, but existentially.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          One of the hardest aspects was the loss of connection. I could no longer call her or share thoughts with her.
          In that absence, I searched quietly for a way to feel connected again. Art became that bridge—not because
          I believed I was good at it, but because it felt like returning to a language she once spoke.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Early attempts were poor. But I continued deliberately, choosing subjects and techniques beyond my ability,
          not to master them quickly, but to grow through discomfort. Over time, something unexpected happened:
          people responded—not with flattery, but with genuine recognition. That restored self-belief and reinforced
          the idea that ability is built through sustained effort and honest feedback.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Digital work eventually felt inevitable. It brought together everything that had shaped me:
          the discipline of craft, the structure of systems thinking, an understanding of perception and meaning,
          and an emotional preference for restraint in a time where much AI-generated work can feel over-produced
          or emotionally hollow.
        </p>

        <p class="card__body">
          Working digitally allowed calm to become a design choice rather than an accident—complexity without noise,
          precision without coldness, and abstraction without emptiness.
